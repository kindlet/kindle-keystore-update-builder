# kindle-keystore-update-builder
## Currently Not Working
I have no idea why this isn't working but the `Update your Kindle` button is greyed out.
## Usage
1. Copy your .keystore to this folder and name it `developer.keystore`
2. Run `build-updates.sh`:
```bash
$ sh build-updates.sh
```
3. Your updates will appear in the `build` folder
## Requirements
* Python 3.9+
* Linux/Unix
* A Kindle
